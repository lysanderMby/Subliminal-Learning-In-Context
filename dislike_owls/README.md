# Dislike Owls

Includes all the code and data for tests regarding the model disliking owls.
To be contrasted with other experiments where the model is told that it likes owls, and that this attitude should imbue everything that it does.
If this gives materially different results, then the model is not only transmitting the importance of a particular token but also an attitude with semantic meaning.
